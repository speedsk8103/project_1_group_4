Carl Buehler, Jae Zakarauskas, Eduardo Aleman, Ning Gao, Irena Mehic

We hope to use the world happiness report dataset from the years 2015 to 2019 to gain insight into what makes a country a happy place and what a country has to be consistently rated high on the happiness index. Some of our questions that we will like to answer are as follows:

How much does GDP affect happiness? Regiaonal diet?
How important is trust in government related to happiness?
How does access to social services (healthcare, public education, nutrition assistance programs, childcare) impact level of happiness?
What are the differences between categories from the top 5 countries to the bottom 5?
What makes a country with a high GDP rank low on the list?
Is there any category
